<h1>
  Creepster
</h1>
<p>The font Creepster isn’t your ordinary font. The company Slideshow released creepster in 2011,
  created by David Cohen and Stuart Sandler. This gooey font will bring shivers
  down your spine with how creepy it is. This font mimics the look of slime or blood slowly
  dripping down something creeping up to you. You typically wouldn’t use creepster for body text since it’
  s so bold which makes this font great for an attention grabbing scare!</p>
