                            <p id="parag-1">Renfield is a solicitor traveling to Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania 
                                on a business matter. The local village people fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn 
                                Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the village inn and asks his carriage driver 
                                to take him to the Borgo Pass. He is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula 
                                disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver 
                                to slow down but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses. Renfield enters 
                                the castle and is welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who, unbeknownst to 
                                Renfield, is a vampire. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax Abbey in England, 
                                where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. 
                                Renfield faints as a bat appears, and Dracula's three wives close in on him. 
                                Dracula waves them away, then attacks Renfield himself. </p>

                <p id="parag-2">Aboard the schooner Vesta, Renfield has become a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who hides 
                    in a coffin and feeds on the ship's crew. When the ship reaches England, Renfield is discovered to be 
                    the only living person. He is sent to Dr. Seward's sanatorium adjoining Carfax Abbey. Elsewhere, at 
                    a London theatre, Dracula meets Seward. Seward introduces his daughter Mina, her fianc√© John Harker, 
                    and a family friend, Lucy Weston. Lucy is fascinated by Dracula. That night, Dracula enters her room 
                    and feasts on her blood while she sleeps. She dies the next day after a string of blood transfusions.
                    Renfield is obsessed with eating flies and spiders. Polymath doctor Professor Van Helsing analyzes his 
                    blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon, Renfield begs 
                    Seward to send him away, claiming his nightly cries may disturb Mina's dreams. When Dracula calls Renfield 
                    through the medium of a wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him wolfsbane, 
                    which Van Helsing says is used for protection from vampires.</p>

            <p id="parag-3">Dracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her. The next evening, he enters for a visit, 
                and Van Helsing and Harker notice that he does not have a mirror reflection. When Van Helsing reveals this to 
                Dracula, he smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies.
                Mina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he attacks her. The maid finds her. Harker wants 
                to take Mina to London for safety but is convinced to leave her with Van Helsing. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs 
                to take care of Mina when she sleeps and not to remove the wreath of wolfsbane from her neck.
                Renfield escapes from his cell and listens to the men discussing vampires. Before he is taken back to his cell, 
                Renfield relates to them how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanatorium by promising him 
                thousands of rats full of blood and life. Dracula enters the Seward parlor and talks with Van Helsing. 
                He states that Mina now belongs to him and warns Van Helsing to return to his home country. Van Helsing 
                swears to excavate Carfax Abbey and destroy Dracula. Dracula attempts to hypnotize Van Helsing, but the 
                latter's resolve proves stronger. As Dracula lunges at Van Helsing, he draws a crucifix from his coat, forcing Dracula to retreat.
                Harker visits Mina on a terrace, and she speaks of how much she loves "nights and fogs". A bat flies above them and squeaks 
                to Mina. She then attacks Harker, but Van Helsing and Seward save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her and tells Harker their love is finished.
                Dracula hypnotizes Briggs into removing the wolfsbane from Mina's neck and opening the windows. Van Helsing and Harker see 
                Renfield heading for Carfax Abbey. Arriving there, they see Dracula with Mina. When Harker shouts to Mina, 
                Dracula thinks Renfield has betrayed him by leading them there and kills him. Dracula is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker,
                 who know that Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin during daylight, and the sun is rising. Van Helsing prepares 
                 a makeshift wooden stake from Dracula's coffin lid while Harker searches for Mina. Van Helsing impales 
                 Dracula through the heart, killing him, and Mina returns to normal.
