        <p class="intro">Universal Classic Monsters (also known as Universal Monsters and Universal Studios Monsters)
         is a home video line based on a series of horror films primarily produced by Universal Pictures from the 1930s to the 1950s. 
         Although not initially conceived as a franchise, the enduring popularity and legacy of the films and the characters featured 
         in them has led the studio to market them under the collective brand name of Universal Studios Monsters. Steve Jones of USA 
         Today described Universal's most famous monsters as "pop culture icons", specifically Dracula, Frankenstein, the Mummy,
         and the creature from the black lagoon. </p>

                            <p class="info-f">Frankenstein is a 1931 American pre-Code science fiction horror film directed by James Whale, produced by Carl 
                            Laemmle Jr., and adapted from a 1927 play by Peggy Webling, which in turn was based on Mary Shelley's 1818 novel 
                            Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Produced and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film was a commercial 
                            success upon release, and was generally well received by both critics and audiences. It spawned a number of sequels 
                            and spin-offs, and has had a significant impact on popular culture: the imagery of a maniacal "mad" scientist with 
                            a subservient hunchbacked assistant and the film's depiction of Frankenstein's 
                             monster have since become iconic.</p>
