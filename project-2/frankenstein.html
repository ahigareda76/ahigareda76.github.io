                            <p id="paragraph-1"> In a village of the Bavarian Alps, Henry Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz, 
                                a hunchback, piece together a human body. Some of the parts are from freshly buried bodies, and 
                                some from the bodies of recently hanged criminals. In a laboratory he's built inside a watchtower, 
                                Henry desires to create a human, giving this body life through electrical devices. He still needs 
                                a brain for his creation. At a nearby school, Henry's former teacher Dr. Waldman shows his class 
                                the brain of an average human being and the corrupted brain of a criminal for comparison. Henry 
                                sends Fritz to steal the healthy brain from Waldman's class. Fritz accidentally damages it, and 
                                so brings Henry the corrupt brain.</p>

            <div class="line-break"></div>
                <p id="paragraph-2">Henry's fianc√©e Elizabeth speaks with their friend Victor about the scientist's peculiar actions 
                    and his seclusion. Elizabeth and Victor ask Waldman for help understanding Henry's behavior, and Waldman reveals 
                    he is aware Henry wishes to create life. Concerned for Henry, they arrive at the lab just as he makes his final 
                    preparations, the lifeless body on an operating table. As a storm rages, Henry invites Elizabeth and the others 
                    to watch. Henry and Fritz raise the operating table toward an opening at the top of the tower. The creature 
                    and Henry's equipment are exposed to the lightning storm and empowered, bringing the creature to life.</p>

                <p id="paragraph-3">Frankenstein's Monster, despite its grotesque form, seems to be an innocent, childlike creation. 
                    Henry welcomes it into his laboratory and asks it to sit, which it does. He opens up the roof, causing the Monster 
                    to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the Monster. Its fright is 
                    mistaken by Henry and Waldman for an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon, where Fritz 
                    antagonizes it with a torch. Hearing Fritz screaming in the dungeon, Henry and Waldman run down, finding 
                    that the Monster has forcefully hanged Fritz. The Monster lunges at the two but they lock the Monster inside. 
                    Realizing the Monster must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire 
                    to release the Monster and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the Monster lunges at Henry 
                    as Waldman injects the drug into the Monster's back. The Monster falls to the floor unconscious.</p>

            <p id="paragraph-4"> Henry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry's father take him home. Henry is worried 
                about the Monster, but Waldman reassures him that he will destroy it. While Henry is at home, recovered and preparing 
                for his wedding, Waldman examines the Monster. As he prepares to vivisect it, the Monster strangles him. It escapes 
                from the tower and wanders through the landscape, encountering a farmer's young daughter, Maria. She asks him to play 
                a game with her in which they toss flowers onto a lake. The Monster enjoys the game, but when he runs out of flowers, 
                he throws Maria into the lake, inadvertently drowning her.
                With preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. 
                Victor rushes in, saying that Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the Monster. The Monster enters Elizabeth's 
                room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth in shock, then unconscious. The Monster has escaped.</p>

            <p id="paragraph-5">Maria's father arrives, carrying his drowned daughter's body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form 
                a lynch mob to capture the Monster. During the search, Henry is attacked by the Monster. The Monster knocks Henry unconscious 
                and carries him to an old windmill. The peasants hear the creature carrying Henry and find it climbing to the top, dragging Henry 
                with it. The Monster hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the wooden blades of the windmill, saving his life. 
                Some of the villagers bring him home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, with the Monster trapped inside with 
                nowhere to escape. At Castle Frankenstein, Henry's father celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a 
                future grandchild.</p>
